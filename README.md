Will be updating this README shortly,

So I far I am building a Next.js Project to model a library system with authentication and multi-user channels as a Fullstack project. The purpose of this project is to showcase a project that has database tracking and backend access as well as a front end for both a user and an admin with a dashboard.

I decided to use ImageKit.io for the ID upload after consulting with GPT for free options. I will be posting install steps soon for those who wish to build their own version of this project. 

The full resources for the visual and image items can be found at

Which models after the Bookwise library store.


I need to add install instructions for the different libraries and features to the program
