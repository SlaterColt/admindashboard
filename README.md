Will be updating this README shortly,

So I far I am building a Next.js Project to model a library system with authentication and multi-user channels as a Fullstack project. The purpose of this project is to showcase a project that has database tracking and backend access as well as a front end for both a user and an admin with a dashboard.

I decided to use ImageKit.io for the ID upload after consulting with GPT for free options. I will be posting install steps soon for those who wish to build their own version of this project.
